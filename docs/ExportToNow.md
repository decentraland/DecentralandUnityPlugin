You need to finish all the registration yourselves.

## Download Decentraland-Unity Plugin

[Decentraland-Unity Plugin](https://github.com/fairwood/DecentralandUnityPlugin/blob/master/downloads/DecentralandUnityExporter.unitypackage)

## Open the exporter and create a Unity scene

First, create a Unity project, better empty.

Then drag the downloaded **DecentralandUnityExporter.unitypackage** file into Unity or use "Import Assets.." in Unity. That will extract all assets into your Unity project.

After a while, you should see a new tab in the menu bar like below.

Click the "Scene Exporter" will open the exporter.

**Note:** an auto-generated GameObject called ".dcl" will be created in the hierarchy. Don't edit it.

You can create a new scene or open the sample scene:
