## Kill DCL Process

DCL process on MacOS has a problem that the process will not stop after you shutdown the ternimal. So we provide a script to kill all DCL processes manually. Just double-click it either in Unity or Finder.

But don't worry if you use ```Start Project``` button, this button will kill old processes automatically.
